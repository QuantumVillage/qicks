    "# Securing The Box\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook helps users to secure their PYNQ instance for resilience in both testing and possible production scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is probably a no-brainer that `xilinx:xilinx` as a login is _really quite bad_, especially for systems that are going to potentially have to undergo security testing and assessment. As such, this notebook exists to help you set this part of the overall system up in order to fix this very low-hanging fruit of a bug. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, the script will do a couple of things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It will change the default password from `xilinx` to a 24 character random string.\n",
    "2. It will add an SSH key to the `xilinx` user's login, and allow you to download the public and private keys to use for both experimentation and/or production.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept for how much security you require is based on 'security level's which are described below. As a minimum, you should change the password and add an SSH key. For more advanced systems or those that may require more security, the script will also edit the SSH server configuration to prohibit password-based login, as well as prohibit `root` user access over SSH. These two actions effectively lock the system to only being accessible using the public/private key pair that has been generated - it is probably only for engineers who know what they are doing. \n",
    "\n",
    "As part of a good defence in depth strategy, every quantum computing system should have sufficient secuirty controls at every level. This script provides added security at the level of the controller, but your own threat modelling and risk management should be applied to the rest of your quantum computing system!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "The security levels in play can be summarised as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* '0' - this is just changing the default password to something long and random, generating a key, and then adding that to authorized keys. \n",
    "* '1' - does everything at level 0, and then proceeds to edit the SSHD config file to prevent root login and prevent password login. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NB** - With security level 1 you MUST have downloaded the SSH private keyfile 'id_rsa' in order to successfully log back in! Run the cells at the end of this notebook to get download links.\n",
    "\n",
    "The security hardening code is in the `secure-ssh.sh` file included in this folder. It is run in the following cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting the Security Level\n",
    "\n",
    "The security level can be set in code as seen below, but also may be set using the BASH commend:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "export QICK_SECURITY_LEVEL=0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the code\n",
    "\n",
    "When this code is run, the output from the script will be diplayed. \n",
    "\n",
    "**You MUST pay attention to the following output block if this is your first time running this script:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "========= WRITE THIS DOWN! =========\n",
    "\n",
    "[!] New Password: ZkMY1QGcB7mNvBKnkpIKaE1z\n",
    "\n",
    "===== THIS IS YOUR NEW PASSWORD!====\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is **IMPERATIVE** that you make note of the new password - it will no longer be 'xilinx'!! Note that your string may vary from this example. However, if you aren't running this script for the first time, this might fail, at which point you can ignore this password and keep your old one. "
